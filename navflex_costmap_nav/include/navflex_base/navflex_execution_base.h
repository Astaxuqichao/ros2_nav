/**
 * @class NavflexExecutionBase
 * @brief Base class for running concurrent/asynchronous navigation tasks
 *
 * This class provides a framework for executing long-running operations (like
 * path planning, trajectory tracking) in a dedicated thread, with support for
 * progress monitoring and cancellation.
 *
 * **Key Features:**
 * - Dedicated execution thread with controlled lifecycle
 * - State-change notification via condition variable
 * - Cancellation support (graceful stop request)
 * - Outcome and message tracking
 * - Pre/post-execution hooks for setup/cleanup
 *
 * **Thread Model:**
 * ```
 * Main Thread (NavflexActionBase::start)
 *   ├─ Create NavflexExecutionBase instance
 *   └─ Call start() to spawn execution thread
 *        │
 *        └─ New Thread (NavflexActionBase::run)
 *            ├─ preRun()  [setup]
 *            ├─ run()     [concrete implementation]
 *            └─ postRun() [cleanup]
 * ```
 *
 * **Execution States:**
 * - Running: Execution thread is active
 * - Ready-to-cancel: cancel() called, execution should stop
 * - Completed: run() finishes, outcome_ and message_ are valid
 * - Stopped: Thread has been joined
 *
 * **Synchronization:**
 * The condition_variable allows waiting threads to be notified of:
 * - State changes (outcome_ or message_ updates)
 * - Execution completion
 * - Cancellation completion
